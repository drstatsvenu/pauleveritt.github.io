==============================

Modern Python development has become quite sophisticated, with large

PyCharm provides a powerful, mature IDE for Python and other technologies
such as web development.

daunting. Wouldn't it be great to learn by writing a Python application,
using the most PyCharmic techniques possible?

PyCharm, using a number of PyCharm features.
