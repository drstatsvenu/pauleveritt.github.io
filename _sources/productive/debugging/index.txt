Todo Comment Counts
===================

- Excuse to debug by stepping through a loop in Python

- Add a fake count of comments, in parentheses, in the listing of
  todos

- Gets a ``@property`` of comments on the class

- This calls some loop which assembles five primes, then randomly
  selects one (as a way to later use the profiler if possible)
