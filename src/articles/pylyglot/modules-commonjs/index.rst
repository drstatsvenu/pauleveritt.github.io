=====================
Modules with CommonJS
=====================

- For the next few steps, things will no longer work in the browser

    - Illustrate how it is broken

- The ``./app`` thing

- Eliminate the ``.js``

- Default exports and named exports

- Get rid of the __name__ hack, as we are now able to import and test,
  which is better than running directly

- The PyCharm whining about ``module`` will be corrected soon

- In PyCharm, you don't have to save before running tests

- Make a test fail
