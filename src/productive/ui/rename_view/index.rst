===========
Rename View
===========

Our view function is named ``hello_world``. Let's change it to ``home_page``.
Along the way, let's get introduced to some of the UI elements in PyCharm.

*TODO Put in links to PyCharm docs as appropriate, probably the last thing
done in the tutorial writing.*

Steps
=====

#. Close all the editor tabs by clicking the ``x`` for each.

#. Click the red button in the left side of the ``Run`` window at the bottom.

#. Click the ``4. Run`` tab button in the bottom of the screen to close that
   tool window.

#. Click the ``1. Project`` tab button in the left edge of window to collapse
   the Project Tool Window.

#. Click it again to re-open.

#. In the Project Tool Window toolbar, click the TODO Image collapse button.

#. Click the ``epc`` folder to expand/open it.

#. Double-click the ``epc.py`` file to open it in the editor.

#. Click somewhere inside the symbol ``hello_world``, putting the caret in that
   function name.

#. From the PyCharm menu, choose ``Refactor -> Rename``.

#. In the dialog box, change ``hello_world`` to ``home_page`` and click
   ``Refactor``.

#. In the next prompt, click the ``Do Refactor`` button.

#. Afterwards, your ``epc.py`` file should look like this:

   .. literalinclude:: epc.py
    :language: py
    :emphasize-lines: 6-8


#. Reload your browser to confirm all is well.

Analysis
========

In this task we made a small change, but used that change to explore
much of the PyCharm UI.

- The editor has tabs which can be closed (plus lots more that we'll see
  later.)

- The IDE has "tool windows" that are placed on the left, bottom, and right

- These tool windows can be toggled open and closed

- Inside the window, each tool has its own little UI (toolbars, tabs, etc.)

- The Project tool is pretty important

- The Editor

Extra Credit
============

#. What does the ``1`` in the ``1. Project`` tool window button indicate?

#. How do you move a tool window button to another part of the screen?

#. What are some ways you can close an editor tab besides clicking the
   ``x``?

#. How do you use the ``Structure`` tool?

#. In the Project tool, the ``templates`` directory is a purple. Why?
