Rename Files
============

``epc.py`` is an ugly filename. Most Flask apps use something like
``app.py`` as the entry-point. Let's ask PyCharm to help us on the
renaming.

Steps
=====

- Right-click on file

- Choose Refactor -> Rename

- Rename to app.py

- Open run configuration and show

- Re-run the run tool and it works

Analysis
========

- Explain that actions (e.g. Rename Files) are available in lots ways
  (menu, context menu, shortcuts, find action, search everywhere, etc.)

- Show places where the rename happened (git, run configurations,
  anything that imported it)

Extra Credit
