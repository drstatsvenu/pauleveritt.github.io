Managing Requirements
=====================

We forgot to add Flask to our ``requirements.txt`` file. In this step we
let PyCharm do this for us, while showing the IDE's ``Preferences``
window.

Steps
=====

- Open preferences, go to ``Tools -> Integrated Tools``, explain

- In ``epc.py``, use Quick Fix to add dependency
  (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2016.1/populating-dependencies-management-files.html)

- Open ``requirements.txt`` and show the new entry

- While we're here, cover remote interpreters, installing packages

Analysis
========


Extra Credit
============

- Can the Quick Fix be used to pin the version in the ``requirements.txt``?

- Why do we specify the test runner in the Preferences?
