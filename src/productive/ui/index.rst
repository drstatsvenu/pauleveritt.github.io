=====================
Project and Editor UI
=====================

PyCharm. It's...big. Lots of windows, buttons, menus. What's that UI all
about?

In this section we go over the major parts of the UI -- the menus, toolbar,
tool windows, editor, etc. -- in the course of some development tasks. In
some cases, it will be obvious and tortured how we are stretching the "Show
PyCharm" goal into the "Build ToDo App" workflow. Hopefully, though, it
will all make sense.

.. note::

    The starting point for this section is the end of the :doc:`../setup`
    section. Meaning, a ``New Project -> Flask`` project.
