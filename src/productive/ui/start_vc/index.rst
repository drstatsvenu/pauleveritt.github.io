=====================
Start Version Control
=====================

PyCharm's ``Project`` tool is a very smart folder browser. We'll show
this by putting our Todo app under version control and seeing how
PyCharm can do work for us, with colors indicating VCS status.

Steps
=====

- Import into local git

- Add file to VC

- Explain color

- Add requirements.txt

- Prompts for .gitignore

- Add sqlalchemy and flask-sqlalchemy entry to requirements.txt

- Explain color indicating "not committed"

- Commit, changes color

Analysis

Extra Credit
============

- Can PyCharm help you manage your ``.gitignore`` file?
