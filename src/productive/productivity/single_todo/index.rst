Steps
=====

#. The constructor looks funny... ``self.title`` should be on the first line.
   Click on that line and press ``Shift-Alt-Up`` to move the line up.



#. Your ``app.py`` should match the following:

   .. literalinclude:: app.py
    :caption: app.py in Single Todo
    :language: py

#. Your ``models.py`` should match the following:

   .. literalinclude:: models.py
    :caption: models.py in Single Todo
    :language: py

Analysis
========


Extra Credit
============


#. We also use ``Shift-Alt-Up`` to move a line up. Can we select an entire
   method and move it, using ``Shift-Alt-Up``?
