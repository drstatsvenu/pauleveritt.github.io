Todo Class
==========

We're going to start a ``Todo`` class, to replace each dictionary in our
`todos`` list. We'll let PyCharm help us with this code refactoring.

Steps
=====

#. Near the top, under ``todos = []``, let's define a class. Type
   the following and stop at that point:

    .. code-block:: python


   .. note::

     Yes, we said ``ToDo`` instead of ``Todo``. We will come back
     to clean that up later.

Analysis
========

- *Refactoring*.



Extra Credit
============


Todo Class
==========

- Excuse to run some refactorings

- Make class ToDo (yes, should be Todo, will use rename later)

- Use autocomplete to complete __init__

- Use navigation to jump back inside the constructor

- Add ``name`` to constructor, then code intention for ``Add field name to
  class ToDo``

- Assign self.id from random.randint, using PyCharm to generate import

- Make a __str__ with .format from code at bottom and explain PyCharm knows
  special methods like __init__ etc.

- Change code at bottom to .join(str(todo)) for all in list

- Reload browser

- Add from models import ToDo in app.py

- We change our mind on ToDo, refactor rename to Todo

- Show that it changes not just in the one file, but everywhere

- Re-run Ctrl-R
